I'm a 3rd-year student studying Mathematical Engineering at YÄ±ldÄ±z Technical University. Solving puzzles has been one of my greatest hobbies since my early years. During my middle school years, upon the recommendation of my computer science teacher, I started researching small vulnerabilities on websites. When I reached high school, there were periods when I had fun with the small vulnerabilities I found on some websites. When I entered university, I began to be interested in how to fix these vulnerabilities, and I took a cybersecurity training from Ecodation Academy. At the end of the training, I had a short-term voluntary internship within the company. During this internship, I gained a better understanding of the background of the work and became even more curious. Currently, I have a good proficiency in Linux and I know how to use Linux tools at a functional level. I am also continuing my education at the Patika & Garanti BBVA Technology Security Academy.
